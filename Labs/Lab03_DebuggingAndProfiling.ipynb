    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "As our example today, we'll look at code for computing the matrix exponential, $e^A$. You should remember this from taking matrix methods APPM 3310.  If $A$ is diagonalizable, then we can compute $e^A$ using eigenvalues; if $A$ is not diagonalizable, it's a bit more complicated. Regardless, computing $e^A$ *efficiently* and *stably* is somewhat challenging and is a [classic problem](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S00361445024180) in numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the standard `scipy.linalg` package to do this for us, and demonstrate how we can debug and profile code, even when we didn't write the code ourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab was tested with SciPy versions 1.11.1 and 1.16.1.  We *hope* it works with most other recent versions!\n",

    "##1. Debugging\n",
    "Note: we **highly** suggest running this in an editor like VS Code, or at least Jupyter Lab (not a plain Jupyter Notebook). You can debug in colab, but it's actually harder because you have to use some command line debugging skills. See this article [Debugging in Google Colab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/debugging-in-google-colab/) if you're curious (it uses the `ipdb` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If using a local editor, like VSCode, there may be a setting that by default does **not** let you debug code from libraries/packages. To make sure you can debug the scipy code, do the following:\n",
    "1. Open the VSCode settings (one way to do this is to click on the gear icon in the lower left hand corner).\n",
    "2. In the settings search bar, search \"debug just my code\".\n",
    "3. This should return a setting/checkbox tilted \"Jupyter: Debug Just My Code\". By default, this is checked/enabled. **Uncheck/disable** this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to debug the scipy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be issues in Jupyter Lab with debugging external code as well. If you really cannot get it to work, let the TA know, and instead write your own code and step through it with the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",

    "## 2. Profiling Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling code refers to looking at running code and noticing what parts of the code take a long time, as well as memory usage.  For memory, you might look at what parts of the code require a lot of memory, or where memory leaks are, or at the cache miss rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going to focus on memory profiling, but instead on time (aka speed) profiling.  A profiler tells us which parts of the code took a long time.  Some profiling tells us which **functions** take a while, other types of profiling tell us which **lines** of code take a while. Today we'll do the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some caveats: to do profiling, the profiler adds some extra overhead, so everything runs a bit slower, and you don't get a 100% accurate picture of exactly how long each part of the code takes. Usually it's accurate enough to give you an idea of where the slowish parts are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programmers avoid formal profiling but just adding timing statements into their code (see section 2c for a  few ways to do this). Sometimes this is easy to do and sufficient, but other times it's not systematic enough and takes more effort than you need; it's also a problem if you want to profile some library code where you don't want to have to edit the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. Example usage\n",
