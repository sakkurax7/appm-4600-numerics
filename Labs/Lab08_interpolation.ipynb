        "- Explore interpolation conceptually, **not** focusing on formulas like the Barycentric formula nor Newton's divided differences\n",
        "- Visualize how Lagrange polynomials work\n",
        "- If the data $y$ are generated by $y=f(x)$, and we interpolate with a polynomial $p$, then we have an error $e(x) = f(x)-p(x)$\n",
        "  - Explore where (in the $x$ domain) the error is the highest\n",
        "  - Consider using nonuniformly spaced $x$ nodes and see the effect on error\n",
        "  - If we refine with $n\\to \\infty$, does $|e(x)|$ get smaller? Is this true for some functions but not others? What properties of the functions might affect it?\n",
        "- Understand that polynomial interpolation comes down to linear algebra\n",
        "  - The Vandermonde matrices for a given basis are useful (even if our practical formulas avoid forming/solving them explicitly)\n",
        "\n",
        "Tasks:\n",
        "1. Lagrange interpolation \"by hand\"\n",
        "2. Trying different node locations: uniform or nonuniform (clustered near edges)\n",
        "3. Look at the error formula for 3 functions, $f(x)=e^{-x}$, $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, and $f(x)=|x|$.\n",
        "4. Make Vandermonde matrices by hand; solve for the coefficients; and create the polynomial\n",

        "*If you are super speedy and finish everything quickly, then look into https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy, a Python wrapper for [chebfun](https://www.chebfun.org/), which is a numerical package (originally in Matlab) for defining functions via their polynomial interpolants (using the [Chebyshev polynomial basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) )*\n",
